go run main.go server - runs the server in one terminal
open another terminal as the client and run functions like - 
./omnidict delete key
./omnidict exists key
./omnidict expire key time(in seconds)
./omnidict flush
./omnidict get key
./omnidict keys
./omnidict put key value
./omnidict ttl key
./omnidict update key value
./omnidict <command> -h/--help (returns stuff like the man pages in your normal cmd - only has the usage as of now we can add these when we add the documentaion)
if ./omnidict does not work try 'go run main.go' instead of that followed by the command and the parameters it take
if there is any problem do tell us :D
